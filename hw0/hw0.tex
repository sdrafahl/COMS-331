 This is an inline equation $x + y = 3$  \\
 This is a displayed equation: \\
 \large \centerline{ $ x + \dfrac{y}{z - \sqrt{3}} = 2 $} \\
 This is how you define a piece-wise linear function: \\
 $$
f(x) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
        3x + 2 & $if x $<$ 0$ \\
        7x + 2 & $if x $ \geq $ 0 and x $<$ 10$ \\
        5x + 22 & $otherwise.$ \\
        \end{array}
    \right.
$$ \\

This is a matrix:

2. Show that N (natural numbers) and Z (integer numbers) are equinumerous.
$\newline$
To show that the set of natural numbers and integer numbers are equinumerous
we have to show the cardinality of N and Z are the same. If there is a function
f: N $\rightarrow$ Z that is bijective then the cardinalities of sets N and Z would
be the same.
\newline

Suppose we have a function where $x \in N$ and $f(x) \in Z$

$$
f(x) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
        0 & $if x equals 0$ \\
        \frac{x}{2} * -1 & $if x mod 2 = 0$ \\
        \frac{(x - 1)}{2} + 1 & $otherwise.$ \\
        \end{array}
    \right.
$$ \\

If f is onto then $\forall_{y} \in $ Z $ \exists_{x} \in N $ where $ f(x) = y $.
Using existential instantiation and universal instantiation either
$\frac{x}{2} * -1 = y$ or $\frac{(x - 1)}{2} + 1 = y$. If $ \frac{x}{2} * -1 = y $.
For $\frac{x}{2} * -1 = y$ is equal to x = -2y and $\frac{(x - 1)}{2} + 1 = y$ equals
2y - 1 = x. If y is negative then for -2y = x, x will equal a natural number. If y is positive
then 2y - 1 = x, x will equal a natural number because it cannot be negative and y cant be 0 because
x will be 0 as well. So therefore for all values of y a natural number of x can be reached so therefor
function f is onto.
$\newline \newline$
Using proof by contradiction assume f is not one to one so $\exists_{x}\exists_{y}(f(x) = f(y)
\rightarrow x \neq y \land x, y \in N \land x, y)$. If x is odd and y is even or vice versa then
$\frac{y}{2} * -1 = \frac{(x - 1)}{2} + 1 $. This can be reduced to y = -x - 1. This is a contradiction
because since x and y are natural numbers they cannot be negative so $ 0 > -x - 1 $ and $ y > 0 $ so therefore
they cannot be equal. If x and y are both even then $ \frac{y}{-2} = \frac{x}{-2} $ which reduces to
x = y which is a contradiction because x and y cannot equal each other. If x and y are both odd then
$ \frac{(y - 1)}{2} + 1 $ = $ \frac{(x - 1)}{2} + 1 $ which reduces down to x = y and for the same
reason is a contradiction because x and y equal each other.
$\newline \newline$
therefore the function f is one to one and onto so it is bijunction and therefore natural
numbers have the same cardinality as integers and are are equinumerous.
$ \newline \newline$
3. Let f : S $ \rightarrow $ S  be a total function. Prove that, if S is infinite, f can be one-to-one without
being onto, and onto without being one-to-one.
$\newline \newline$
For f to be one-to-one but not onto for f(x) = y where $x \in S $ and $ y \in S $ there is at least one value
of y and x $ f(x) \neq y $.

$$
f(x) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
        x + 1 & $ if x $ \geq $ 0 $ \\
        x - 1 & $otherwise.$ \\
        \end{array}
    \right.
$$ \\
$ \newline $
Function f cannot be 0. If x is greater or equal to 0 then 0 = x + 1. The only value for x where this could be
true is x = -1 but x cannot be a negative number. Otherwise for 0 = x - 1 x would need to be equal to 1
but x cannot equal or greater than 0 so therefore for either case 0 is an element of S but $ f(x) \neq 0 $.
