ABSTRACT = {
  We present a novel algorithm for generating state spaces of
  asynchronous systems using Multi--valued Decision Diagrams.  In
  contrast to related work, we encode the next--state function of a
  system not as a single Boolean function, but as cross--products of
  integer functions.  This permits the application of various iteration
  strategies to build a system's state space.  In particular, we
  introduce a new elegant strategy, called \emph{saturation}, and
  implement it in the tool SMART.  On top of usually performing several
  orders of magnitude faster than existing BDD--based state--space
  generators, our algorithm's required peak memory is often close to the
  final memory needed for storing the overall state space.

ABSTRACT = {
  Many techniques for the verification of reactive systems rely on the
  analysis of their reachable state spaces.  In this paper, a new
  algorithm for the symbolic generation of the state spaces of
  asynchronous system models, such as Petri nets, is developed.
  The algorithm is based on previous work that employs
  Multi-valued Decision Diagrams for efficiently storing sets of
  reachable states.  In contrast to related approaches, however, it
  fully exploits event locality, supports intelligent cache
  management, and achieves faster convergence via advanced
  iteration control.  The algorithm is implemented in the Petri
  net tool SMART, and run-time results show that it often performs
  significantly faster than existing state-space generators.
