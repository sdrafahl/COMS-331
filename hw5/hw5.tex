    (a): The number of reads is $ 10^{8} $.

    $ \newline $

    (b): There are possible $ 10^{8} $ because it is not garenteed that each read is unique. 
    
    $ \newline $

    (c): To design a MDD I would create an initial 4 starting options. A,T,G,C and then each level
    would break up into all the possible combinations. For example A to go to a G in the decision diagram and 
    continue onwards. We would also have to account for the reverse compliment of the DNA so each decion would
    split off into two different options. One for the reverse compliment and one for the standard.
