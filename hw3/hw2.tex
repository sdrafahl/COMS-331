    1. Prove or disprove every finite language is recognized by some FA.
    $ \newline \newline $
    A finite language can be represented by a regular expression because
    if the language is finite then we can order the strings in some sort of order
    $ s_{0}, s_{1}, s_{2}, ..., s_{n} $ where n is equal to the number
    of strings substracted by 1 in the finite alphabet. We could simply union every string 
    together $ s_{0} + s_{1} + s_{2} + ... + s_{n} $ to make a regular expression. We know from
    2.7 of the LanguageBook.pdf from the Definition that a language L is regular iff
    it can be represented by a regular expression so we know a finite language is regular.
    The theorem states that a language is regular iff it is accepted by a finite automaton so 
    therefore we know that every finite language is recognized by some FA.

    2. Define a DFA, simplified to the best of your abilities, that recognizes the language 
    L = $ \{\ w \in  { \{\ a,b \}\ }^{*} : $ w does not contain the substring abba $ \}\  $
