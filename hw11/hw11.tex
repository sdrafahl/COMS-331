    $ \footnotesize L = \{\ p(M)p(w):$ M uses a finite number of tape cells when running on input w $ \}\ $
    $ \newline $
    This language is acceptable because it only has a finite number of tape so even if the input is greater than
    then memmory storage it can only hold a finite number from the input. This language is not decidable because
    if M needs to process info from the whole input w, if there are w/2 finite memmory on the tape it can
    never process the whole tape. 

    $ \newline $

    $ \footnotesize L = \{\ p(M)p(w)01^{n}0:$ M uses at most n tape cells when running on input w $ \}\ $

    $ \newline $
    
    This language is acceptable but not decidable. The turring machine input may not be able to store the
    entire input. $ p(M)p(w)01^{n}0 $ = $ 01^{m}001^{}0 $ where m is the number of instructions for the head
    for machine $ M $. We can use $ n $ at most tape cells so we cant get stuck in a infinite for loop
    because its finite but we cannot read both machines that are deliminated by 0's so it can not be decidable.

    $ \{\ p(M) : |L(M)| \leq 10 \}\ $
