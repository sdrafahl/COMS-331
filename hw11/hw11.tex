    $ \footnotesize L = \{\ p(M)p(w):$ M uses a finite number of tape cells when running on input w $ \}\ $
    $ \newline $
    This language is acceptable but not decidable. It is not decidable because the size of the tape is unknown.
    We can create a turing machine that simply gives M the input w and L and check that it used a finite number of tape
    cells. Essentialy $ p(M)p(w) $ is the same as the problem $ \{\ P(M)p(w) : M \searrow w \}\ $ which we know is not decidable.

    $ \newline $

    $ \footnotesize L = \{\ p(M)p(w)01^{n}0:$ M uses at most n tape cells when running on input w $ \}\ $

    $ \newline $
    
    This language is decidable because we know the number n of tape cells that you can check. If it loops we can check 
    if the head goes beyond n cells. If it loops over the same cells we can count the number of times it goes over the cells.

    2.

    $ \newline $

    $ \{\ p(M) : |L(M)| \leq 10 \}\ $

    $ \newline $

    This language is turing-decidable because the languge has a cardinality less than or equal 
    to ten. The turing machine could simply have a finite number of states to represent every possible
    string in $ L(M) $ and either print a Y or a N based on those strings.

    $ \newline $

    $ \{\ p(M) : |L(M)| \geq 10 \}\ $

    $ \newline $

    This language is not acceptable because the language is some length greater than 10. 
    If the turring machine does not halt we do not know if its looping forever or if it has just not
    reached the end of the language yet. 

    $ \newline $

    $ \{\ p(M)p(w) : M \searrow w $ in 10 steps or less $ \}\ $

    $ \newline $

    This is turing decidable because it has a finite number of steps so we know for sure it 
    halts. If in 10 steps it has not printed a Y then it would print a N by the last step.

    $ \newline $

    $ R = \{\ p(M)p(w) : M \searrow w $ in 10 steps or more $ \}\ $

    $ \newline $

    This language halts so we know it is acceptable. We will use reduction to prove it is not
    decidable. We know from the class notes that $ \{\ p(M)p(w) : M \searrow w \}\ $. 
    If we build a machine $ M^{'} $. This machine first takes input $ w $ and checks
    that it is at least 10 steps. If not it adds more steps to the tape. This tape is then given
    to $ R $. If $ R $ returns a Y or a N then $ M^{'} $ returns a Y or a N otherwise it loops.
    So therefore $ R $ reduces to $ \{\ p(M)p(w) : M \searrow w \}\ $ so the language is only 
    accepting by not decidable.

    $ \newline $

    3. Use reduction to prove that the language is not decidable.

    $ \newline $

    $ L = \{\ p(M_{1})p(M_{2}) : L(M_{1}) \subseteq L(M_{2}) \}\ $
    
    $ \newline $

    We know that $ R = \{\ p(M)p(w) : M \searrow w \}\ $ is not decidable so if we can reduce L into 
    R we can prove that L is not decidable. If we make a machine where all input to a machine is given
    to $ M_{2} $. $ M_{1} $ is a subset of $ M_{2} $ so any $ x \in L(M_{1}) $ would not halt given to L 
    because all words in $ L(M_{2}) $ are in $ L(M_{1}) $. This would mean that
    $ M_{2} \searrow x $. So This machine would have a turring machine that first takes in a input
    and then if it halts the $ x $ is returned to another turring machine that is given to 
    $ \{\ p(M_{2})p(x) : M \searrow x \}\ $. This is the same as R via homomorphism so therefore L is 
    not decidable.
