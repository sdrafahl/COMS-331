    1. Use the pumping lemma to prove that L = $ \{\ ww : w \in \{\ 0,1 \}\ ^{*} \}\ $ is nonregular.
    $ \newline \newline $
    We will prove this by proof of contradition and assume that L is a regular language. So therefore 
    for L, $ \exists_{n} \in N $ such that $ \forall_{x} \in L $, if $ |v| \geq n $, then x can be decomposed
    into three strings $ \exists_{u, v, w} \in \{\ 0,1 \}\ ^{*} $. Where x = uvw. $ |uv| \leq n, |v| > 0 $ such
    that $ \forall_{k} \in N, uv^{k}w \in L $.
    $ \newline \newline $
    Because there are two w's we know that $ |ww| = 2a $ where $ a $ are some natural number.
    Suppose that uvw = $ a^{p}b^{l}a^{p}b^{l} $ where $ p + l = n $, p and l are natural numbers.
    This implies that $ v = b^{i} $ where some $ i $ is a natural number greater than 0. Suppose that 
    $ uv^{2}w $ = $ a^{p}b^{l + i}a^{p}b^{l} $. $ |uv^{2}w| $ = $ p + l + i + p + l $ = $ 2(n) + i $. This is 
    a contradiction because the cardinality is no longer a multiple of 2 and should be in the language but it is not
    so therefore L is not regular.
    $ \newline \newline $
    2. Prove that $ L = \{\ w \in \{\ a,b \}\ ^{*} : |w|_{a} \neq |w|_{b} \}\ $ is not regular.
    $ \newline \newline  $
    Using the closure properties we can take the complement of language L 
    and take its complement $ L^{'}(M_{1}) $ = $ \Sigma $ \ $ L_{M} $.
    $ L^{'}(M_{1}) = \{\ w : \{\ a,b \}\ ^{*} |w|_{a} = |w|_{b} \}\ $. 
    We can then concat $ L^{''}(M_{3}) = L^{'}(M_{1}) * L^{'}(m_{2}) $ where 
    $ L^{''}(M_{3}) = \{\ ww : \{\ a,b \}\ ^{*} |w|_{a} = |w|_{b} \}\ $.
    That last part we can use homomorphism where $ a \rightarrow 0 $ and $ b \rightarrow 1 $.
    To get $ L^{'''}(M_{4}) = \{\ ww : w \in \{\ 0,1 \}\ ^{*} \}\ $ we proved in question 1
    that $ \{\ ww : w \in \{\ 0,1 \}\ ^{*} \}\ $ is not regular and because we produced a non-regular language
    from the closure of two regular languages that is a contradiction so therefore L is not a regular language.
